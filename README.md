# Crypto-SAS
Cryptographic algorithms and protocols implemented in SAS language

In SAS language, you can encrypt a full dataset, and there are a few cryptographic primitives that can be applied at variable level but, in general, you can't perform a variable-level encryption with, for example, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).

In this project, an implementation for the AES in SAS is implemented. Several algorithms will be added in near future.
