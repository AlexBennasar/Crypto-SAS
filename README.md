# Cryptographic algorithms and protocols in SAS language

In SAS language, you can encrypt a full dataset, and there are a few cryptographic primitives that can be applied at variable level but, in general, you can't perform a variable-level encryption with, for example, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES).

## The Advanced Encryption Standard (AES)
In this project we provide and implementation for the AES in SAS. With it, the user can encrypt macrovariables and dataset variables, without the need of performing full dataset encryption in this last case.

Several algorithms will be added in near future.
